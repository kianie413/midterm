        <h2>Financial Resources</h2>
        <p>Attending college is all fun, until the hidden costs begin to appear. The FIRST Resource Center offers a range of
            resources to help students in the center reach their opportunities. We understand that while Tufts covers the 
        basic needs, there are additional costs that can be stressful for a college student to handle by themselves. Below
        are a list of financial resources the FIRST Resource Center offers students who are low income, first-generation, and/or
        undocumented.</p>

                    presenting at a conferece, equipment for sports, plane tickets for COVID-19 cirumstance, etc..</p>
