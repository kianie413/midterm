         <h1>Financial Resources</h1>
         <p>Attending college is all fun, until the hidden costs begin to appear. The FIRST Resource Center offers a range of
             resources to help students in the center reach their opportunities. We understand that while Tufts covers the 
            basic needs, there are additional costs that can be stressful for a college student to handle by themselves. Below
            are a list of financial resources the FIRST Resource Center offers students who are low income, first-generation, and/or
            undocumented.</p>
