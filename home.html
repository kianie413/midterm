        <p> <br> <i> FIRST welcomes any student who self identifies with the first generation college student experience. By strengthening the bonds between our community members and bridging the gap between Tufts’ resources and first gen students, FIRST aims to ensure that first-gens are empowered in, and prepared to reach their full social, professional, and academic potentials. </i> </br> </p>

                <p> The FIRST Center works to provide the necessary financial knowledge, information about Tufts, and access to opportunities and resources for students to be successful during their time at the University. The FIRST Center believes it is imperative that first gen students are provided an inclusive space that is sensitive to their intersecting identities and where their shared experiences can be validated. The FIRST Center celebrates the first- gen identity and passionately advocates for the trailblazers among us who are the first in their families to attend an elite, private institution like Tufts. </p>
